# TODO List for Matrix Class ✨

## Implementation Tasks 🚀

### Existing Functionality 💻

- 🛠️ Implement the constructor to validate and initialize the matrix.
- ➕ Implement the `add` method to support matrix addition.
- ➖ Implement the `sub` method to support matrix subtraction.
- ✖️ Implement the `multiply` method to support matrix multiplication.
- 🔄 Implement the `transpose` method to return the transposed matrix.
- 🔍 Implement the `compare` method to check for equality between matrices.
- 🔢 Implement the `scalarMultiply` method to support multiplication by a scalar.
- 🟢 Implement the `identity` method to create an identity matrix.
- ⬜ Implement the `zero` method to create a zero matrix.
- 📄 Implement the `toString` method for easy matrix representation.

### Future Enhancements 🔮

- 📝 **Matrix Determinant**: Implement a method to calculate the determinant of a square matrix.
- 🛠️ **Matrix Inversion**: Implement a method to calculate the inverse of a square matrix.
- 📊 **Matrix Rank**: Implement a method to determine the rank of a matrix.
- 📏 **Matrix Scaling**: Enhance the `scalarMultiply` method to support vector scaling.

### Error Handling ⚠️

- ⚠️ Improve error messages for more clarity.
- ❌ Implement validation to handle non-numeric values within matrices.
- 🚫 Ensure that operations on uninitialized or empty matrices provide meaningful errors.

## Testing Tasks 🧪

### Existing Tests ✅

- ✅ Write tests for matrix addition with valid dimensions.
- ✅ Write tests for matrix subtraction with valid dimensions.
- ✅ Write tests for matrix multiplication with valid dimensions.
- ✅ Write tests for matrix transposition.
- ✅ Write tests for comparing matrices for equality.
- ✅ Write tests for scalar multiplication.

### Additional Test Cases 📝

- 🔍 Write tests for edge cases:
  - Empty matrices and matrices with only one element.
  - Very large matrices to validate performance and efficiency.
- 📏 Validate the determinant and inversion methods once implemented.
- ❗ Create tests for incorrect dimensions during matrix operations:
  - Ensure all methods handle invalid dimensions appropriately.

## Documentation 📚

- 📜 Add comprehensive comments and documentation for each method in the `Matrix` class to explain its purpose and functionality.
- 📝 Update `README.md` to include details about any new methods and their usage instructions.
- 📖 Create examples for new features in the `README.md` to demonstrate their functionality.

## Code Quality 🔧

- ✔️ Review code for adherence to best practices and coding standards.
- 🔄 Refactor any repetitive or complex code segments for better readability and maintainability.
